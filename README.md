This project uses glove's database
please download it from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/   (we used this version http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) and make sure it's in the same folder as the python script


We use many imports that need installation before hand.
here is the list:
pickle 
numpy
pandas
keras
tensorFlow
sklearn
pyswarms



please note that this is a heavy project for the computer. You might need a small corpus, a lot of running time, and a 64bit computer.

# The List 
# PSO - theres an implemented version 
# RNN - read more about bidirectional lstm \ gru \ lstm, need to implement a function that takes hyper parameters  and returns a trained model 
# Data Analysis - get word frequencies AND max sentence length , vocalbulary size etc ... 
# Data Cleaning - impleemtn a function that reads the data from the dataset files and cleans and tokenizes the data for the rnn use + positional transformation\reduction
